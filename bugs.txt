01: The update_user_images function will delete old images from the file when the user updates the for header or avatar image
but in the event that the user causes an error like a duplicate key error from using an email or username that already exist, 
the image has already been saved. if you delete the image when you catch the error you will be deleting the image thats been saved.
This should all get better with using a service like cloudinary to store images. storing in a file is too complicated.
